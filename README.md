## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niladrridas/gan.git
   cd gan
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Initiate GAN training:**

   ```bash
   python src.py
   ```

   This command will start the training process. The GAN will generate images at predefined intervals, with results saved in the project directory.

2. **Monitor Training:**

   Track the evolution of generated images over epochs to witness the progressive improvements in quality.
