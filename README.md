# GAN Image Generation

Generate realistic images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This project focuses on training a GAN on the MNIST dataset to create synthetic handwritten digits.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niladrridas/gan-image-generation.git

## Usage
1. Run the GAN script:

`python gan.py`

This will initiate the training process. The GAN will generate images at specified intervals, and the results will be saved in the project directory.

2. Monitor the training process:

Observe the quality of generated images over epochs and explore the generated content.
